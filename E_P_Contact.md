## Inferring 3D Structure from chromatin contacts

[Pastis-NB: Nelle Varoquaux et al. Bioinformatics 2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36594573/) Modeling overdispersion of HIC data to predict 3D structures, by using NB model instead of Poisson model from their previously published Pastis-PM method.




## Structural Variation (CNV, SV) analysis






## CRISPR / experimental validation of E-P contacts, regulatory regions

[CRISPRQTL - Gasperini et al. Cell 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30612741/) validated E-P pairs by high throughput CRISPR purturbations in thousands of cells.

[Bergman et al. Nature 2022](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35594906/) proposed Exp-STARRseq - compatibility rule between enhancer and promoter sequences.
