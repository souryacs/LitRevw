## Circulating tumor DNA and Minimal residual disease (MRD)

#### 2023

[Review: Moser et al. Trends in Genetics 2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36792446/) Reviews ctDNA and MRD detection methods, various sequencing and methylation techniques, and particularly ML-based techniques.

[Maansson et al. Mol Oncol. 2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36825535/) Uses H3K36me3 cfChIP and gene expression (generated by CAPP-seq using cfChIP) to show that cfChIP and gene expression are correlated, cfChIP identifies DEGs, and EGFR (or any other mutated genes) are enriched in H3K36me3 cfChIP-seq.
