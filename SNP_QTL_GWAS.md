## Identifying disease-risk / causal variants (and) target genes

[3DFAACTS-SNP: Liu et al. Epigenomics and Chromatin 2022](https://epigeneticsandchromatin.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13072-022-00456-5) proposed T1D causal variant identification pipeline: 1) Bayesian fine mapping, 2) Overlap with ATAC-seq peaks (open chromatin region), 3) HiC ineractions, 4) FOXP3 binding sites.
