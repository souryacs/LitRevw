## Gene expression / modules

[A genome-wide atlas of co-essential modules assigns function to uncharacterized genes - Wainberg et al. Nature Genetics 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33859415/) GLS (Generalized least square) based framework to detect co-essential gene modules specific to cell / tissue types which can be candidates for perturbation experiments. Differs from CRISPR in the sense that CRISPR background is a single gene while co-essentiality models genetic and phenotype characteristics of a given cell line. Uses CRISPR cell line from Achillis project for implementation, benchmarks with databases CORUM, STRING, hu.MAP, COXPRESdb, DoRothEA. Gene modules are derived by ClusterOne package. GLS regression is performed by Cholesky decomposition, and the input gene effects are obtained by CERES scores. Provides interactive webtool <http://coessentiality.net>.
