[VIMCCA - Wang et al. Bioinformatics 2023](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36622018/) Variational inference method - generalizing CCA. Multi-view latent variable. CCA is modeled by multi-view latent variable and variational distribution. Maximizing log likelihood is modeled as maximizing evidence lower bound (ELBO). It has 2 components - KL divergence, and reconstruction error. SGVB estimator using monte carlo simulator is used to estimate the ELBO.
