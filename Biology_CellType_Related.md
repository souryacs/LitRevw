## Regulatory regions, genes

[Nguyen et al. Frontiers 2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26441967/) discussed important regulatory regions and genes for T cell differentiation. 1) Th2 lineage: expression of Cytokine IL-4 (and also IL-5, IL-13), RAD50 genes, and differentiation by TF GATA3, STAT6. 2) Th1 specific genes: Ifng and Tbx21. In general, STAT family of TFs are responsible for T cell differentiation.

[Cano-Gamez et al. Nature Comm 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-020-15543-y) derives T cell differentiation lineages using single cell transcriptomics and prioritizes cytokines and genes important for T cell differentiation.

[Andreatta et al. eLife 2022](https://elifesciences.org/articles/76339) used scRNA-seq and TCR to identify key marker genes for T cell differentiation (check figures 1-4 for a complete list of T cell lineage deriving marker genes).

[Rundquist et al. Frontiers Immunology 2022](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2022.835625/full) discussed marker genes for T cell differentiation to Th1 (Fig. 2) and also the progesteron hormone during pregnancy and its effect on MS and RA.

## SNPs

[Soskic et al. Nat Genet 2022](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41588-022-01066-3) derived single cell eQTLs and in particular, time-dependent dynamic eQTLs for T cell differentiation (Suppl. Table 8). They used both linear and nonlinear dynamic eQTL model and derived FDR for both. They highlighted IL7R, CD69, IL2RA, IRF1, TOP2A as important genes.

[Bossini-Castillo et al. Cell Genomics 2022](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.xgen.2022.100117) identified Treg specific eQTLs, chromatinQTLs, and also colocalized with various immune disease specific GWAS SNPs. Good repository for Treg specific marker genes and SNPs.

[Ohkura et al. Immunity 2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2020.04.006) identified Treg specific genes and putative causal genes, specifically in CTLA4 and IL2RA loci. They also provided a concept of GWAS LD-SNP group, by considering all SNPs with LD (R2 > 0.8) and MAF > 0.1 with the lead GWAS fine-mapped SNP (PICS) within 50 Kb, as a LD group of SNPs.
