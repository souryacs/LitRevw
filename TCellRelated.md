## Regulatory regions, genes

[Nguyen et al. Frontiers 2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26441967/) discussed important regulatory regions and genes for T cell differentiation. 1) Th2 lineage: expression of Cytokine IL-4 (and also IL-5, IL-13), RAD50 genes, and differentiation by TF GATA3, STAT6. 2) Th1 specific genes: Ifng and Tbx21. In general, STAT family of TFs are responsible for T cell differentiation.
