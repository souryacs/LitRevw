## Review papers - ML in computational Biology

[Machine learning applications for therapeutic tasks with genomics data - Huang et al. Patterns 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34693370/) Very important review paper. Discusses about different domains in genomics for ML application, including sequence specific expression, causal genes, variants, pathways, spatial transcriptomics, drug targets, CRISPR targets, drug response prediction and many more. Can be used for all ML based problem formulation.

## ML / DL Seminal papers

### 2017

[Attention is all you need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) - Transformer model from Google Brain

### 2018

[Graph Attention Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903) Concept of GAT. Uses binary edge connectivity (neighborhood) information, without edge features. Discusses the limitations of spectral approaches which uses graph laplacians (i.e. adjacency matrix representations and eigendecompostion, where the trained model heavily depends on the graph structure and cannot be applied on the graphs with different structure). Attention is useful since arbitrary neighborhood and graph structure (with different weights) can be supported, resulting in an inductive learning.
